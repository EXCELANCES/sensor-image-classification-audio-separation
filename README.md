# Sensor Image Classification & Audio Separation Project

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline focused on classifying images from sensor-based manufacturing data and separating audio signals using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The project is structured into three major parts:

### Part 1: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

* Task: Multi-class image classification.
* Dataset: 7 labeled image classes - `bad_Zn`, `good_Zn`, `bad_Ti`, `good_Ti`, `bad_Tin`, `good_Tin`, `medium_Tin`.
* Preprocessing: Image resizing (128x128), grayscale conversion, normalization.
* Techniques: Data augmentation, class weighting for imbalance handling.
* Model: CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, and Dropout layers.
* Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and confusion matrices.

### Part 2: Random Forest & XGBoost

* Task: Traditional ML-based image classification.
* Feature Engineering:

  * Statistical descriptors (mean, std)
  * Edge detection (Sobel, Canny)
  * Filtering (Gaussian, Median)
* Dimensionality Reduction: PCA retaining 95% variance.
* Data Balancing: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
* Models:

  * Baseline: Random Forest with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
  * Advanced: XGBoost classifier with extensive parameter grid.
* Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, confusion matrices.

### Part 3: Audio Signal Separation via ICA

* Task: Separate music and white noise mixed into stereo audio.
* Techniques:

  * Signal synchronization and stereo conversion.
  * ICA using `FastICA` to separate source signals.
  * Spectrogram visualization for original and separated signals.
* Output: Mixed and separated `.wav` files.
